**Website summary:** This website is iVET360's Plan of Action report. A link to the report can be found using the link above (this is an example of what a client would receive from our team). I take hospital data via a form submission, pass that data to this results page using the Gravity Forms API, compare the data to see if the client is passing/failing benchmarks, and display this report on the frontend.

This project uses PHP to do the heavy lifting of bringing the data in, it uses JavaScript to add ineractivity to the report, and it uses CSS for styling.

For a deep into the code on this page, check out the files to see how this runs.
