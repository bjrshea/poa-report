# Plan of Action Report

**Website summary:** This website is iVET360's Plan of Action report. A link to the report can be [found here](https://poa.ivet360.com/poa-results/?entry_id=3) (this is an example of what a client would receive from our team). Essentially, I take hospital data via a form submission, pass that data to this results page using the Gravity Forms API, compare the data to see if the client is passing/failing benchmarks, and display this report on the frontend.

One of the features I had the most fun building is the index on the Your Plan tab that dynamically updates depending on the objective card you're hovering on.

For a deep into the code on this page, check out the files to see how this runs.
